## Datadekho (DATA VISUALIZATION APPLICATION):-

In the current landscape of technological advancements, organizations wield the power to make data-driven decisions and formulate strategic plans and forecasts. However, a plethora of business users find themselves pressed for time, hindering their ability to delve into data analysis and extract meaningful insights. Bridging the gap between the raw output generated by analytical tools and its practical interpretation poses a challenge. Moreover, constructing valuable business insights demands a commendable domain knowledge, a skill not possessed by every user.
To address these issues, we envision creating a system capable of weaving a narrative from a given data snapshot. This system aims to automate the storytelling process, leveraging data, contextual information, and personal preferences. By doing so, it not only streamlines tool utilization but also serves as a guide for users, furnishing them with data-driven intelligence crucial for making informed business decisions. The overarching objective is to drive outcomes and enhance overall effectiveness in decision-making processes.

## üìù Module-Wise Description


_üìå **Data Upload**_ <br/>

This module deals with the data upload. It can take csv and excel files. As soon as the data is uploaded, it creates a copy of the data to ensure that we don't have to read the data multiple times. It also saves the columns and their data types along with displaying them for the user. This is used to upload and save the data and it's column types which will be further needed at a later stage. 

_üìå **Change Metadata**_ <br/>

Once the column types are saved in the metadata, we need to give the user the option to change the type. This is to ensure that the automatic column tagging can be overridden if the user wishes. For example a binary column with 0 and 1s can be tagged as numerical and the user might have to correct it. The three data types available are:

* Numerical 
* Categorical 
* Object

The correction happens immediately and is saved at that moment. 

_üìå **Machine Learning**_ <br/>

This section automates the process of machine learning by giving the user the option to select X and y variables and letting us do everything else. The user can specify which columns they need for machine learning and then select the type of process - regression and classficiation. The application selects multiple models and saves the best one as a binary `.sav` file to be used in the future for inferencing. The accuracy or R2 score is shown right then and there with the model running in the background.
